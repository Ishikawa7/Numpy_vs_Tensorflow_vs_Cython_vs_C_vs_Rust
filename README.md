# Matrix Multiplication test
This repository contains test of matrix multiplication performance for several programming languages and packages.
The languages and packages tested include:
- C language (naive)
- C language (slightly optimized)
- Rust (naive)
- Python Numpy (built in method)
- Python Tensorflow (built in method)
- Cython (naive)

The matrix dimensions tested were: 10x10, 100x100, 1000x1000

## Hardware
The tests were done on my machine whose technical details can be found in "hardwareinfo.txt".

## Description
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many scientific and engineering applications. The goal of this benchmark is to compare the performance of different languages and packages for matrix multiplication, and to provide insights into which languages and packages are best suited for different use cases.

## Results
The results of the benchmark are provided in the "results.csv" file, which contains the execution times for each language and package.
